# Game-auto-start
This is my first project on github, can also be as called as my first automation project. This project auto starts "PLAY GAME", so I need not to wait for a whole loading screen. Not only I can make rdr2 game auto play, this code can be resued for any game by simply changing the target_image(auto start condition image), start_key(starts the game). By simply adjusting those with little condtion its possible to auto mate game start for any games. :)
In my code I automated the game start for RDR2, so you will find the 'auto start condition image' as story.png. For any desired game feel free to update the 'auto start condition image' with your own image.
