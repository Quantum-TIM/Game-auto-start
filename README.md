# Game-auto-start
This is my first project on github, can also be as called as my first automation project. This project auto starts "PLAY GAME", so I need not to wait for a whole loading screen. Not only I can make rdr2 game auto play, this code can be resued for any game by simply changing the target_image(auto start condition image), start_key(starts the game). By simply adjusting those with little condtion its possible to auto mate game start for any games. :)
